# Bad_Words: The FlexWord Blocklist

> "It's a PG-13 world; I'm just living in it."

**FlexWord** allows mild profanity and common insults but excludes language whose primary purpose is to demean or dehumanize people based on identity.

### The Philosophy: Context is Critical
As a word game, FlexWord presents a single word at a time, without a surrounding sentence to help define it. 

* **We allow** words that have widely used meanings outside of their offensive context.
    * *Example:* We allow `cripple` because it is a common verb (e.g., "to cripple the economy"), even though it can be an ableist slur in other contexts.
* **We ban** words whose main function is to demean or dehumanize people.

Some words people expect to find here aren’t included on purpose. Language is messy. Since FlexWord shows words in isolation, banning context-dependent terms would punish normal English usage rather than prevent harm. 

This list is intentionally narrow. It targets hate speech and severe vulgarity, not everyday profanity or slang.

## 🚫 How to Contribute

Language evolves, and reasonable people can disagree about edge cases. We welcome community input to keep this list accurate.

**Your proposal must address:**
1.  Is the word’s primary contemporary use to demean or dehumanize people based on identity?
2.  Does the word have a common, neutral meaning outside of offensive use?
3.  Would banning the word create unnecessary false positives in a context-free word game?
4.  Does the word fit a PG-13 standard, rather than a zero-tolerance filter?
